# NasaApplicationBot (SCRAPPED)

UPDATE 2022: I initially started creating this bot because when I first applied for internships at NASA there was no option to carry application information over to another application. I didn't want to spend time repeating the same information so I got to work on this bot. However as of writing this (11/19/2022), there is now an option to carry over information to another application. Now there is no need for me to finish this bot. However it was still fun to start it :)!

Just for my own safe-keeping, these were the last ideas I wrote down on what I was going to implement:

1. Make global variables for like name and short answer1, short answer2 et etc. The short answers can take .txt files maybe?

2. Write a date like "Last working August 2022". 

3. Bring out a GUI form where you put the info once and then the program has it forever and then it's easier to apply maybe?

4. For any repeating parts write functions


I programmed a web scraper to apply to multiple NASA internships for me because the applications asked for the same information and I felt like a bot would free up time for me to do other work. Exam time creeped up and I believe I missed the window for applications. However I plan to apply another time again, so I will finish the both then. The logic/code is the same as the beginning part, just need to do it for the rest of the application.

A python program that uses Selenium to scrape the NASA internships website and input my information for me.

Userful when applying to multiple internsips
