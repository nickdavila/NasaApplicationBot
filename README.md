# NasaApplicationBot
I programmed a web scraper to apply to multiple NASA internships for me because the applications asked for the same information and I felt like a bot would free up time for me to do other work.

A python program that uses Selenium to scrape the NASA internships website and input my information for me.

Userful when applying to multiple internsips
